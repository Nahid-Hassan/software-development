### Making Convincing Arguments

Discrete mathematics is the language of computer science. One needs to be fluent in it in order to be able to work in fields like data science, machine learning, software engineering, and others.

**Course Objectives**: How to `understand`, `invent`, `explain` and `enjoy` **proofs**. 

#### Proofs

**Proofs**: An argument that is so convincing that you are ready to use it to convince other people.
